This is my nvim setup which has been optimized for LaTeX. There is a lot of functionality here. I will be adding a details how-to-guide soon. Until then, you can begin by downloading the following then cloning my repo into your ~/.config/nvim directory.

You will need to download nvim 0.5.

You will need to install packer

You will need to change the color of your terminal to match the one being used. If you are using iTerm2 then you can simply use the appropriate color in the color folder.

You will also need to use :LspInstall to install the appropriate language servers.

Good luck!
